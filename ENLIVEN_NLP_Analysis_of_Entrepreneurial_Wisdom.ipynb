The ability to think quickly and adapt, and a supportive family Victor Jackson - Above all, I consider myself the most valuable asset; therefore, I good care of myself., Bizarrely out of the box thinker, Considering things from different perspectives\\xa0 Loves receiving feedback and implementing changes My family legacy and family are the biggest assets in my business., His most valuable asset is his problem-solving ability and the ability to create relationships to support the business. For an example, I would have creating a business model, that would have aligned me in setting business goals and focus on impacting the market more Jamie stated, “I wouldn’t change a thing.”\\xa0 , Would not do it again, if I did it again would start online first, overhead costs would be way less, only still open because I own the building Overall, I am happy with the way the business turned out., Mr. Kwok responded a solid “yes” and confirmed that he would like to start a business again in the same way if he has more capital and his children are willing to become the successors of the business. \\u202fShe also gave a lot of advice throughout the interview- listen to people, don’t get discouraged, continuously learn, don’t be afraid to fail, etc.\\xa0\\xa0 I would suggest having a plan of action or business model for how you want to grow your business and how you plan to do it., Stay close to the money and you will gain much more insight on how the business operates\\xa0 “Pick the people you want to go hunting and fishing with”., He also mentioned that if an aspiring entrepreneur indeed decided to start a business, make sure he or she communicates the concept with his or her family members in order to prepare for any unforeseen trade-offs that may impact the family relationship negatively.\\xa0 , Having your business plan in place, looked at by someone (other than people who love you), have a very good attorney (an objective one), and having an “up to date” accountant/CPA is very critical – all a must. Having a majority self-ran business is key, having the right systems in place can save you a lot of time and being open to change will allow your business to sustain even in challenging times. , “The top 3 things that I’ve learned from this experience was to always complete your own research, make sure to plan for any derailleurs that may come into play and always build relationships with people who are like minded and can be a resource to help develop me.”\\xa0 Be patient., Lesson of contentment – your business may not make a ton of money, but some is better than none.\\xa0Lesson of stepping out of comfort zone - take calculated risks., Your customers are people, your employees are people, and your investors are people., Be passionate about the business or venture and see the business as a passion and not only a money-making venture.  I feel I did not have to chase business growth like I would imagine entrepreneurs do. , Unlike most small business entrepreneurs, my venture was a lot of the right place at the right time and through word of mouth., My parents helped guide me, but they also had money saved when they started their business and a dual income, so I launched my business at a different level from them.\\xa0 , “I wish before we started our business, we had more resources or connections to help make unplanned events easier to handle or deal with.”\\xa0 , That is not easy, and life will not be easier after starting the business, that owning a business will reduce your freedom, contrary to the concept that you can make your own schedule. , , A business that operates in a busy area with a value-added product needs substantial marketing and advertising to maximize the business’s sales.
